# basketball-court-annotation-tool

This repository concerns a full self contained Basketball Court Annotation Tool in the R shiny framework, using javascript and its object notation (json) to draw and make annotations in real time.These drafts/diagrams/plays/... can be exported as .png to print and serve as a reference.


### Court design
* Half court or full court designs
* Official scaled NBA dimensions
* Additional border to permit drafts that start from a throw-in situation
  
### Annotation tools
* Player indicators (1-5)
* crosses/triangles/circles
* straight, curved, terminated and squiggly lines in either solid or dotted configuration to identify dribbles, runs, screens and passes
* six basic colors (yellow, red, orange, blue, green and purple)

### Export capability
* As a .png that just encompasses the annotated area

### Simplicity
* Barebones, straightforward UI
* limited package depencencies (just shiny & shinydashboard)
* lightweight & super responsive
* No local installation, easily webhosted through shiny's versatility.
